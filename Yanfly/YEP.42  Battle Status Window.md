## YEP.42 – Battle Status Window

***
### Introduction
***

This plugin replaces the default battle status window, which was shown in a row format, to a column-based format that also displays the party’s faces.

这个插件代替了默认战斗状态窗口，可以基于队伍行列展示队伍的头像

For frontview users, this plugin also allows you to enable battle animations to be played on top of the actor’s portraits (and showing any damage popups) to give the player a better view of what’s going on in battle.

对于前视战斗模式，这个插件允许你战斗的时候得到更好的效果
