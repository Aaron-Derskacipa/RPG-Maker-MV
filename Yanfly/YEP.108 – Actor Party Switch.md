##YEP.108 – Actor Party Switch
***
###Introduction
***
This plugin requires YEP_PartySystem and YEP_BattleEngineCore. Make sure this plugin is located under both plugins in the plugin list.

这个插件需要YEP_PartySystem和YEP_BattleEngineCore支持，确保放在它们下面。

For games that benefit more from individual party switching, this plugin grants players the ability to switch party members on an individual basis rather than entire parties at a time mid-battle. However, actors that have just switched in and are on cooldown, required for battle, or locked in the party position cannot switch out.

对于那些依赖队伍成员切换的游戏，这个插件可以让玩家直接切换队员而不是进行整个队列的调整。并且，我们设置了切换冷却和锁定队员的功能
